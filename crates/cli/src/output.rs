//! What the tool writes for its caller: the answer on standard output, everything else on standard
//! error - and neither of them may crash it (R4-S11).
//!
//! `println!` and `eprintln!` panic when a write fails, and a pipe whose reader has gone fails every
//! write. Measured before this module existed: `chrono version`, `chrono calc` and a `chrono run`
//! with nobody reading ended in a panic and exit code 101, which no table documents, and the core
//! wrote its diagnostics through the same macros - so a panel that died took the core down in the
//! middle of `close_session`, before it put the family back on rate 1 (ADR-14).
//!
//! The rule is the one docs/08 already had for `--report`: an output that cannot be written is said
//! on standard error where that is still possible, and the exit code stays what the command found.
//! `tests/hygiene.rs` (H10) keeps the panicking macros out of the shipped code.
