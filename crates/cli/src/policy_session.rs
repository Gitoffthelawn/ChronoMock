//! What a session does about the machine registry for an application that runs as administrator
//! (docs/09 section 12.19), and what it says about it.
//!
//! The registry work itself is `chrono_mech::policy_value`. This is the session's side of it: whether
//! to do anything at all (the tester asked, the core is elevated, the target is an `.exe`), what to
//! tell the tester about what was and was not done, and the one guarantee that matters - a value this
//! session wrote is taken away before the verdict goes out, and by `Drop` on every other way out.
//!
//! The registry is behind [`Registry`], so every decision here is tested with a registry of the test's
//! making and never with the machine's.
