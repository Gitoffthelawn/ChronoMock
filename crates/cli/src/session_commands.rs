//! `query`, `set_multiplier` and `jump` mean the same on the native path and on the Chromium one, and
//! the interface cannot tell which ran (docs/08). They used to be answered by two functions that
//! agreed by copying - the refusal of a rate out of range, the reading of a jump target, the order of
//! `ack` and `state` - and the copies had drifted before (R5-P18, R5-P19). The protocol half is written
//! here once, and each mechanism says only how its clock moves, through [`SessionClock`].
