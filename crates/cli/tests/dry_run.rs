//! The one promise `--dry-run` makes that no unit test can check: it starts nothing.
//!
//! Everything else about the flag is a pure rendering, tested where it is built. This is the other
//! half - the branch that returns before the spawn. A unit test cannot see that branch move, because
//! moving it below the spawn changes no value it could read. So this runs the real executable against
//! a target that would leave a mark on the filesystem, and looks for the mark.
//!
//! The target is the command interpreter with a `mkdir` into a scratch directory. Chosen because the
//! evidence is a directory rather than parsed output - present or absent, with nothing to interpret.
//!
//! It is named by FULL PATH, and that is not tidiness. The first version of this file wrote `cmd.exe`
//! and the control below failed: the mechanism hands the target to `CreateProcessW` as
//! `lpApplicationName`, which Microsoft documents as never using the search path. That failure is
//! what corrected `--dry-run` itself, which until then declined to judge a bare name.
