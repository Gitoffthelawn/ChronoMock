//! A reader that goes away must not crash the tool (R4-S11).
//!
//! `println!` and `eprintln!` panic when the write fails, and a pipe whose reader has closed fails
//! every write. So `chrono run app.exe --json | head -n 3` ended in a panic and exit code 101, a
//! number no table documents, and the core spoke through the same macros: a panel that died took the
//! core down in the middle of `close_session`, before it put the family back on rate 1 (ADR-14).
//!
//! Each case hands the binary a pipe whose read end is already closed. That is deterministic where a
//! real `head` would race the first write, and it is exactly what the child sees once any reader has
//! gone: every write fails. The exit code is then checked against the one the same command line
//! gives with somebody reading, because a closed output changes what reaches the caller, not what
//! the tool found.
