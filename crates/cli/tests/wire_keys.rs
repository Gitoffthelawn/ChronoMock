//! Guard for the wire-key contract: every translation key the core puts on the NDJSON wire must
//! exist in BOTH shipped translations. A key that reaches the panel without one renders as raw
//! jargon - the RELEASE-002 class, which a pre-release audit already had to close once by hand.
//!
//! Why this guard exists at all: the GUI side keeps `CoreWireKeys` in `LocalizationTests.cs`, a
//! MANUALLY maintained list whose own comment says "when the core adds a rendered key, add it
//! here". Nothing checked that list against reality, and it had already drifted - the audit of
//! 2026-09-05 found `moment.unsupported_kind`, emitted from a live jump path, missing from the
//! list and from both translation files. A guard written in prose but absent from code is worse
//! than none (untouchable rule 12), so this is a real test that fails on a real gap.
//!
//! Two sets, checked by two tests, because the core names its failures in two different SHAPES.
//!
//! The first is keys that travel over the wire as an event field, written as bare string literals.
//! The second is the calculator's, which the engine writes INSIDE an English sentence on stderr -
//! `chrono calc: step 1 needs a calendar - pass --calendar (calc.needs_calendar)`. The shape scan
//! cannot see those: the literal it finds is the whole sentence, which is not key-shaped, so every
//! `calc.*` key was invisible to this guard.
//!
//! That invisibility had a cost. Eight of the nine calculator keys had no translation at all and the
//! panel showed the engine's raw sentence - wrong language, a process name, and the contract key in
//! brackets - while this file's own header said calculator errors "are not translation keys". They
//! are: the GUI maps `calc.X` to `calc.err.X` (CalcErrorText), which is what the second test below
//! holds it to.
