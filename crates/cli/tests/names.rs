//! Strings that must never appear in the repository, whatever a session is in the middle of writing.
//!
//! Two kinds, one mechanism. Untouchable rule 26: no application we measure Chrono Mock on is ever
//! named here. And the personal data in the code-signing certificate's subject: a certificate issued
//! to an individual carries their name, town and province, every signed file carries it with them,
//! and that exposure is the certificate's to make rather than the repository's - only the fingerprint
//! belongs in `packaging/codesign.json`.
//!
//! The rule was written down and nothing checked it, which is how it came to be broken in seventeen
//! places across ten committed files - including the public README and both language versions of a
//! live website page - for as long as the repository has been public. A rule in a document with no
//! guard in the code promises a protection that does not exist (rule 12).
//!
//! WHY THE LIST IS HASHED. A guard that spelled the forbidden names out would put them back in the
//! repository itself, which is the thing it exists to prevent. So it carries FNV-1a of each name in
//! lowercase, and a failure reports the file, the line and WHAT SORT of name it is, never the token
//! it matched - CI logs on a public repository are public too.
//!
//! FNV-1a is not a security choice and does not need to be one. Nothing here resists an attacker,
//! it only avoids writing the names down. A 64-bit collision would show up as a false positive on
//! one word, which a person then reads and dismisses.
//!
//! WHAT MAY BE NAMED, and this is the line the code already drew for itself in `report.rs`: engines,
//! runtimes and protocols. `Chromium`, `Electron`, `.NET`, `Java`, `Python`, `Unity` are what the
//! product's own features and warnings are defined in terms of, and a warning that will not say
//! which runtime it is about cannot be acted on. What may never be named is the application someone
//! pointed the tool at.
//!
//! ADDING A NAME. Hash it with the helper in `tools/` and add the pair below. Two things to check
//! first: the name must not be an ordinary English word (the scan is a whole-word match, so a common
//! word would fire on prose everywhere), and the hint must describe the category rather than the
//! product.
//!
//! EXCEPTIONS are whole lines, not names, and they are the maintainer's to make - rule 26 is
//! untouchable, so a session that finds itself wanting one asks instead of adding it. Each exception
//! is one exact line in one file (`ALLOWED_LINES`), so the same name written anywhere else, or that
//! line changed by a single character, fires the scan again. The ceiling on how many there are only
//! comes down.
