//! Characters that do not show as themselves.

//! Text this tool did not write reaches a terminal and an evidence file: the names in a calendar or a
//! preset someone shared, the words a target sends about itself. A character that is invisible or
//! steers how the rest is shown can make that text say something it does not (R5-B1): a carriage
//! return and an erase-line sequence printed a fake `result:` line over the real one, and a
//! right-to-left override reverses what follows it on screen. Judged here, once, so the readers of
//! catalogue files and the quoting of a target's words cannot disagree about what counts.

/// The format characters (general category Cf) of Unicode 18.0, and the two separators, as inclusive
/// code point ranges. Control characters (Cc) are asked of the standard library, which knows them.

/// Source: `DerivedGeneralCategory-18.0.0.txt` of the Unicode Character Database
/// (unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/extracted/), every line in category Cf. Written as numbers on
/// purpose - a tool that edits this file may turn an escaped character into the real one, which would
/// put the very characters this list is about into the source. A later Unicode version can add to the
/// category, and adding a range here is the whole change.
