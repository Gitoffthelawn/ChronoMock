//! Ending the family of a session that refused to go on (R4-S5).
//!
//! When the opening verdict says the substitution did not take effect, the core does not leave the
//! application running: every minute a tester spent in it would be evidence about the real clock that
//! looks like a time-shifted run. It used to end only the process it launched, and whatever that
//! process had started in its first moments ran on, on the real clock, with nothing to say so.
//!
//! The family is not in one place at that moment. The hook signs the processes it followed into the
//! registry, the ring names the children it could not follow, and a process the hook never saw at all
//! is only in the system's process list. That list alone cannot be trusted: a parent pid is a number
//! the system recycles, so a process whose parent ended long ago can name a pid our target holds
//! today, and ending it would end somebody else's work. So every step from a parent to a child is
//! checked by creation time - the child was created after its parent, and before the moment the list
//! was taken - and a process that cannot be asked when it was created is never ended.
//!
//! Every process found is held by a handle until the end, so no pid of the family changes hands
//! between rounds. The root ends first, before the first list, so it starts nothing more, and up to
//! three rounds catch what a member started while the round before was ending the others.
