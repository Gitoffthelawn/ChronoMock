//! The processes a session lasts for.
//!
//! A session used to end with the process it launched. A launcher, a restart after an update and a
//! batch script that runs `start app.exe` all end that process on purpose and leave the application
//! running, with the hook in it (ADR-3). Ending the session there let the application go back to the
//! real clock seconds after it started, and a launcher that ended inside the opening guard window
//! was even reported as a single-instance application (measured, tools/probes/starter). The session
//! now lasts for as long as any process on its clock is running: the one it launched, or any process
//! the hook followed into (ADR-16).
//!
//! A member is watched through a handle opened the first time its sign-in slot is seen, so a pid the
//! system recycles later cannot keep the session alive. The one gap left is a member that ended and
//! had its pid recycled before that first look - a child poll is 100 ms apart. It is closed by the
//! creation time the member's hook wrote into its slot: the process behind the handle either was
//! created then, or is somebody else under the same number (R4-N12). Where that cannot be asked, the
//! process snapshot answers instead, by who started the process: a recycled pid belongs to a process
//! started by somebody outside the family. The snapshot alone used to decide, and it turned away a
//! real member whose parent it did not know - a child started with a parent chosen for it
//! (`PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS`), which the session then ended under.
