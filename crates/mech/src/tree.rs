//! The process tree under a root pid, from a system snapshot.
//!
//! A session under the hook knows its family from the registry every hooked process signs into,
//! plus the ring of children the hook never got into. A probe that launches a host WITHOUT the hook
//! has neither, and the embedded-engine channel still needs to know which processes are the host's:
//! the DevTools port belongs to the family, and a port owned by anybody else is not ours to speak
//! to. `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` is the one system-wide list of processes with parent pids, and
//! walking it from the root down is the family.
//!
//! Read every time it is asked, never cached: an engine spawns its processes seconds after the
//! host starts, and a snapshot from before then would say the family is the host alone.
